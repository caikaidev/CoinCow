# GitHub Actions & Google Play Deployment Fixes

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve GitHub Actions build failures and prepare for Google Play Store deployment.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Java Version Mismatch ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflows were using JDK 11, but Gradle configuration requires Java 17.

**Solution**: Updated both workflow files:
- `.github/workflows/build-check.yml`: Changed from JDK 11 to JDK 17
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Changed from JDK 11 to JDK 17

### 2. Missing Widget Receiver Class ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `AndroidManifest.xml` referenced `CryptoWidgetReceiver` class that didn't exist.

**Solution**: Created `app/src/main/java/com/kcode/gankotlin/widget/CryptoWidgetReceiver.kt` with proper Glance widget implementation.

### 3. Improved Keystore Handling ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Signing configuration had weak error handling and could fail silently.

**Solution**: Enhanced keystore validation in `app/build.gradle.kts`:
- Added null checks for environment variables
- Added keystore file existence validation
- Improved fallback to debug keystore
- Added detailed logging

### 4. Enhanced Build Error Detection ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Build failures weren't properly detected and reported.

**Solution**: Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml`:
- Added keystore validation step
- Enhanced build command with `--stacktrace --info`
- Added proper error checking and exit codes
- Improved build artifact verification

## New Files Created

### 1. `CryptoWidgetReceiver.kt`
Complete widget receiver implementation using Glance framework.

### 2. `scripts/test-build.sh`
Local build testing script that mimics GitHub Actions environment:
- Validates Java version
- Checks prerequisites
- Runs complete build pipeline
- Reports build artifacts

### 3. `scripts/fix-github-actions.sh`
Automated fix script for common GitHub Actions issues:
- Updates Java version in workflows
- Checks for missing files
- Validates configuration
- Provides setup guidance

### 4. `GOOGLE_PLAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
Comprehensive guide for Google Play Store deployment:
- Step-by-step deployment process
- Required secrets configuration
- Store listing guidelines
- Troubleshooting common issues

### 5. `GITHUB_ACTIONS_FIXES.md` (this file)
Summary of all fixes and improvements made.

## Required GitHub Secrets

Configure these secrets in your GitHub repository (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

```
KEYSTORE_BASE64     - Base64 encoded release keystore file
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD   - Password for the keystore
KEY_ALIAS          - Alias name for the signing key
KEY_PASSWORD       - Password for the signing key
COINGECKO_API_KEY  - API key for CoinGecko service
```

### How to Generate Keystore Secrets

1. **Create keystore** (if you don't have one):
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.keystore -alias release -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

2. **Encode keystore to Base64**:
```bash
# macOS
base64 -i release.keystore | pbcopy

# Linux
base64 -i release.keystore | xclip -selection clipboard
```

3. **Add to GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add each secret with the corresponding value

## Testing the Fixes

### Local Testing
```bash
# Run the test build script
./scripts/test-build.sh

# Or run individual commands
./gradlew clean
./gradlew lintDebug
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

### GitHub Actions Testing
```bash
# Create and push a test tag
git tag v1.0.0-test
git push origin v1.0.0-test

# Monitor the build at:
# https://github.com/your-username/CoinCow/actions
```

## Deployment Workflow

### Automated Release Process
1. **Create version tag**: `git tag v1.0.0`
2. **Push tag**: `git push origin v1.0.0`
3. **GitHub Actions automatically**:
   - Builds signed AAB
   - Creates GitHub release
   - Uploads artifacts
4. **Download AAB** from GitHub release
5. **Upload to Google Play Console**

### Manual Release Process
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Build and Release AAB" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter version name and code
5. Download generated AAB file
6. Upload to Google Play Console

## Verification Checklist

Before deploying to production, verify:

- [ ] All GitHub secrets are configured
- [ ] Local build test passes (`./scripts/test-build.sh`)
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow completes successfully
- [ ] AAB file is generated and signed
- [ ] ProGuard mapping file is created
- [ ] Version codes are incremental
- [ ] API keys are properly configured

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Build Fails with "Keystore not found"
**Solution**: Verify GitHub secrets are set correctly and keystore is valid.

### Java version errors
**Solution**: Ensure workflows use JDK 17 (already fixed).

### Widget-related compilation errors
**Solution**: `CryptoWidgetReceiver.kt` has been created (already fixed).

### Version conflicts
**Solution**: Ensure each release has a unique version code.

### API key issues
**Solution**: Verify `COINGECKO_API_KEY` secret is set in GitHub.

## Next Steps

1. **Commit all changes**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions and prepare for Google Play deployment"
git push origin main
```

2. **Configure GitHub Secrets** using the values from your keystore and API keys.

3. **Test the workflow** by creating a version tag:
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

4. **Monitor the build** in GitHub Actions tab.

5. **Follow the Google Play deployment guide** in `GOOGLE_PLAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Run `./scripts/test-build.sh` locally to identify issues
3. Verify all required secrets are configured
4. Review the troubleshooting sections in the deployment guide
