# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for preparing the Crypto Tracker App for Google Play Store deployment. The focus is on implementing automated AAB (Android App Bundle) packaging, proper APK signing, and meeting Google Play Store requirements for a successful app publication.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated AAB Packaging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically generate AAB (Android App Bundle) files through GitHub Actions, so that I can efficiently prepare release builds for Google Play Store submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release tag is pushed to the repository THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a GitHub Actions workflow to build an AAB file
2. WHEN the AAB build process runs THEN the system SHALL use the production build configuration with proper optimization settings
3. WHEN the AAB is generated THEN the system SHALL upload it as a GitHub release artifact for easy download
4. IF the build fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and notifications

### Requirement 2: APK Signing Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to properly configure APK signing for release builds, so that the app can be uploaded to Google Play Store with consistent signing credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building a release APK/AAB THEN the system SHALL use a secure keystore for signing
2. WHEN keystore credentials are needed THEN the system SHALL retrieve them from secure environment variables or GitHub Secrets
3. WHEN signing is configured THEN the system SHALL support both debug and release signing configurations
4. IF keystore is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL fail the build with clear error messages

### Requirement 3: Google Play Store Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the app meets Google Play Store requirements, so that it can be successfully published without rejection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is built THEN the system SHALL target API level 34 (Android 14) as required by Google Play
2. WHEN the app requests permissions THEN the system SHALL include proper permission declarations and usage descriptions
3. WHEN the app is packaged THEN the system SHALL include all required metadata (version codes, version names, app descriptions)
4. WHEN the app uses network features THEN the system SHALL include proper network security configuration
5. IF the app contains sensitive permissions THEN the system SHALL provide justification in the app description

### Requirement 4: Build Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the app build for production release, so that the app size is minimized and performance is maximized for end users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for release THEN the system SHALL enable ProGuard/R8 code shrinking and obfuscation
2. WHEN resources are processed THEN the system SHALL remove unused resources to reduce APK size
3. WHEN the build is optimized THEN the system SHALL generate mapping files for crash reporting
4. WHEN debugging symbols are processed THEN the system SHALL strip debug information from release builds

### Requirement 5: Version Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically manage version codes and version names, so that each release has proper versioning for Google Play Store requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new release is created THEN the system SHALL automatically increment the version code
2. WHEN version information is set THEN the system SHALL use semantic versioning for version names
3. WHEN building from different branches THEN the system SHALL handle version conflicts appropriately
4. IF version code conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate version uploads

### Requirement 6: Release Asset Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically manage release assets and metadata, so that all necessary files are available for Google Play Store submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a release build completes THEN the system SHALL generate and store the signed AAB file
2. WHEN mapping files are created THEN the system SHALL store ProGuard mapping files for crash analysis
3. WHEN release notes are needed THEN the system SHALL generate or use provided release notes
4. WHEN assets are uploaded THEN the system SHALL organize them in a clear, accessible manner

### Requirement 7: Security and Credentials Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to securely manage signing credentials and API keys, so that sensitive information is protected while enabling automated builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing keystore files THEN the system SHALL use encrypted storage or secure environment variables
2. WHEN accessing credentials THEN the system SHALL use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information
3. WHEN API keys are needed THEN the system SHALL inject them securely during build time
4. IF credentials are compromised THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for credential rotation
